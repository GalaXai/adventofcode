# Advent of Code  Solutions

## Overview

Welcome to my repository for the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) and [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges! This repository serves as a record of my solutions and a platform to share my learning journey with others interested in similar challenges.

## Structure

Each year's challenge is organized into its own directory:

- `adv22/`: Contains my completed solutions for the Advent of Code 2022.
- `adv23/`: Ongoing solutions for the Advent of Code 2023.

Within each directory, you'll find:
- `XX/`: A folder for each day of the challenge, where `X` represents the day number.
  - `XX.py`: The Python script containing my solution for that day, where `X` represents the day number, sometimes if the code if to big for one file you could see `XX2.py` as for part2
  - `in.txt`: The input data provided for the challenge.
  - `teset.txt`: The test data provided for the challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
